Assignment 2 - Binary Search Tree (35%)

Overview

Your task is to implement a BST class, where every vertex is denoted by a string, and every vertex has a weight. The class should allow the weight to be any numeric data type, such as int, float, or double. The vertices are sorted by their weights.

*For example, the following BST has 8 vertices: "C", "A", "H", "D", "G", "F", "B", "E" (we list the vertices in breath-first traversal order). These vertices have weights of 5, 1, 10, 3, 20, 15, 30, 17.*

The class should offer a reasonably effective suite of operations, including but not limited to:

- Adding and removing nodes (and relevant edge adding and     removal).
- Depth-first and breadth-first traversals (Preorder,     Inorder, Postorder, BFS).
- Finding paths that meet certain conditions.

The Code

You are provided with two files:

- tree.hpp: this includes most of the basic definitions you will     need. **You should define data structures** to represent a Binary     Search Tree **and implement the functions** so that they can work     correctly**.** You may add new includes, classes, functions, and/or     variables to the class per your need, as long as they do not interfere     with the existing definitions. You must NOT change the class name,     template, parameters, or return types of functions.

- main.cpp: this includes a main     function. You may write some code to test your data structures and     function implementations for the class. This file will not be marked so     you can do anything you like with it -- just ensure it does not cause any     error. When the "*run*" button is pressed, it will compile     and run main.cpp.

The code has been commented on to explain the purpose of each function. Remember to read over all the code before starting.

When the "*mark*" button is pressed, your code in tree.hpp will be run against the tests in Ed. The testing code can only mark your code when your code does not cause a program crash. If you get any error during compiling or your program cannot stop by itself, make sure you fix that problem first!

The basic data structures and the possibilities for implementing BSTs have been covered in [Week 6 Lecture](https://edstem.org/courses/5386/lessons/8464/slides/60684) and [Week 7 Tutorial](https://edstem.org/courses/5386/lessons/8488/slides/60901). Note that, the remove_vertex function should cause the minimum change to a BST -- the removal methods are illustrated in Week 6 Lecture. Some parts of the task may require you to develop some thinking because **the lectures may not readily give you the solution**. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you are unclear about the task requirements.

Marking

The assignment will be marked against three components:

**Functionality (26%)** will be marked automatically when you press the "*mark*" button and will be verified by the teaching team.

**Design (6%)** will be marked by your tutor, who will evaluate your design of data structures & algorithms and may ask questions regarding your code. It will be marked qualitatively against the following rubric:

- Pass     The code shows a basic understanding of how to employ data structures to     achieve a goal. The design should avoid unnecessary data structures and     should make reasonable use of iteration and recursion when appropriate.
- Credit     The design shows a solid understanding of data structures and demonstrates     effective use of control structures to achieve the programâ€™s goals.
- Distinction     The design shows a high degree of understanding of how to use data     structures to achieve a goal efficiently and demonstrates some evidence     that the design does not use unnecessary resources. The design should be     clean and efficient.
- High Distinction     The design demonstrates a high degree of understanding of data structures     and how to efficiently employ them to build algorithms that not only meet     technical goals but also support maintenance and future development.

**Style (3%)** will also be marked by your tutor. It will be marked qualitatively against the following rubric:

- Pass     The code mostly uses some formatting standards and is somewhat readable.
- Credit     The code adheres well to a formatting standard and variables are well     named.
- Distinction     At least as well formatted as for Credit standards, along with sufficient     inline commenting to explain the code.
- High Distinction     Excellent formatting and variable naming. Excellent, judiciously employed     comments that explain the code without just repeating the code.

We highly recommend you to **attend your Week 11-12 tutorials in person** so that you can demonstrate your code and get immediate feedback when you are being marked in *design* and *style*. Alternatively, if you cannot attend tutorials in person, you should **provide a video (2-3 mins length)** explaining the merits (in *design* and *style*) of your code for Programming Assignment 2. Your tutor will give your marks in *design* and *style* based on your code and video explanation. You may share your video through Google Drive, OneDrive, YouTube, or in any other form with your tutor -- just make sure your tutor can access it.

Submission

**You must submit your code by pressing the "\*mark\*" button on Ed.** No other forms of submission will be accepted. You are welcome to develop your code elsewhere, but remember it must compile and run on Ed. The underlying g++ compiler in Ed is set to C++17 for this assessment. Usually, code that compiles with clang++ should also work with g++.

You may submit as many times as you like before the due date.

Due Date

Code submission is due by 14 May 2021 at 5:00 PM. A 10% penalty applies to all late submissions made within a week after the due date. No code submissions will be accepted after 21 May 2021.

In-class code demonstration is due in Week 11-12 tutorials. Alternatively, video submission should be made before your Week 12 Tutorial. No late demonstration or video submission will be accepted.

Plagiarism Checking

All code will be checked for student misconduct and plagiarism using specialised code similarity detection software.
